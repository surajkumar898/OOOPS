variable shadowing is the same variable  have the different values.
Method shadowing is the parent and child class have the same method and having static method 
The process of hiding the implementation but providing the important features 
Abstraction is implement by the two ways 
Abstract class and Interface 
In Abstract class, can have both abstract and non abstract method, it support single inheritance, can have various types variabels are final, static and non static, provide some implementation details. 
It can extend other classes and implement the interface.
Abstract class is used to archieve single level inheritance.
Abstract class is  allow static and non static method, so abstraction is reduced 
Using Interface, we can archieve the 100% of abstraction and  multiple inheritance.

Characteristic of Interface 
Interface does not allow constructor, we can archeieve multiple inheritance 
Interface does not allow object creation.
Interface allow static method and body to make it function. but it cannot inherit the class 
three types of interface 
regular interface, functional interface, Marker interface.

Regular Interface 
The interface containing more than one abstract methods.

Functional Interface 
The interface containing only one abstract method is called as functional interface.

Marker Interface 
Interface containing zero abstract method
Serizable(), clonable(),random access()
