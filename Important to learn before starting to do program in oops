In a Non Static members, if we want to print non static object then we have to call the method by creating the object,
by using the object to call the method. all these thing are done inside the main method class.
class Student {
    void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello from non-static method!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student();  // ✅ object created
        s1.sayHello();               // call using object
    }
}
In a Static members, if  i we want to print the the values, then i dont need to create the object,
instead of that, inside the main methid  i call the method without object,
i use the static method and classname.

class Student {
    static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from static method!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student.greet();  // ✅ call without object
    }
}
