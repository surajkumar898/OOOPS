Inheritance consist of 4 types Single-lvl-Inheritance Multi-lvl-inheritance hierachial-lvl-inheritance hybrid-lvl-inheritance
Single-lvl-inheritance - child class acquring property and behaviour  from the  parent class. this can be implement by using non static multi line intializer 
class bike{
    void details(){
        System.out.println("Bike model is yamaha");
    }
}
    class power extends bike {
    void details1(){
        System.out.println("Bike cc is 150");
    }
}
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        power vech= new power();
        vech.details();
        vech.details1();
    }
}
let I give   u  a  real time example let us take bike model like yamaha it has characteristic of the 155 cc of power engine followd by i would give mileage of 20km per liter  here parent class have characteristic of bike mode 
whereas child class inherits the property of bike cc, mileage color from the parent class.

Multi-lvl-inheritance
Every parent class have one child  
The parent class is Bike, which has general features like the model name.

The child class Yamaha inherits from Bike and adds more specific features, like engine CC.

Then, a grandchild class YamahaSports inherits from Yamaha and adds its own details, like mileage.
